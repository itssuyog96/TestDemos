                <span>The richest bank in the known world, the Iron Bank of Braavos has been steadily funding the Iron Throne since the reign of Robert Baratheon. Would-be kings and conquerors turn to the Iron Bank for financial backing for their rebellions, ever aware that should they come to power, "The Iron Bank will have its due." As hand to his grandson King Joffrey, Tywin Lannister - the richest man in Westeros - historically continued to borrow heavily from the bank. The Iron Bank is located in the Free City of Braavos. It is arguably the most powerful financial institution in the Known World, with clients across Essos and Westeros, including the government of the King of the Andals and the First Men who rules over the Seven Kingdoms. </span>

                <h4>History</h4>
                <hr />
                <span>The Iron Bank was founded long before the Doom of Valyria, when Braavos was still a "secret city", hidden from the Valyrian Freehold. It was formed by successful traders and craftsmen. Its name comes from the abandoned iron mine in which the bank's founders placed all their funds. The mine had a single entrance, which they sealed with heavy gates and iron bars and protected by guards hired jointly by all the members. The Iron Bank has moved to new, grander quarters since that day, but the mine is still employed as a depository, as well as being a historical site of the city.</span>
